# iss-tracker
Small webapp that pulls the current iss position from an api and tracks it across a google map

## Setting it up

This project is very minimal and all you need to make it work is your own 

**Google Maps API Key**

Please get one from here [Aquiring a key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup)
Put your aquired key into **token.js**

````
var googleMapApiToken = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
````

That's it!

## More?

If you wish to change the map style drop your json style into **mapstyle.js**. It's pretty easy.
